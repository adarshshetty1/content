  code: This use case detects the unusual/suspicious outgoing emails over the Web
    Service  using AI .In this usecase, suspicious  number of attempts performed by
    a sender to send emails over the Web Service is observed.Adversaries may use an
    existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their
    primary command and control channel.User behavior monitoring will help to detect
    abnormal patterns of activity.This att&ck can be mitigated by  using web proxies
    to enforce an external network communication policy that prevents use of unauthorized
    external services.
